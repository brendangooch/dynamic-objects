v2.0.0 - completely refactored
    
    updated with latest config templates

    DynamicUnit vastly simplified
        implemented Decorator pattern for additional functionality (ie inverted unit returns 1 -> 0)

    refactored other classes to reflect changes to DynamicUnit

    created separate DynamicVector and DynamicBezier classes
    DynamicPosition now uses those classes internally

    added speed() method to number, vector, bezier, position so client can set speed OR duration
    added changeBy()/moveBy() methods to number, vector, bezier, position as a convenience to client
    
    TESTED ALL FUNCTIONALITY VISUALLY + ALL JEST TESTS PASS



v3.0.0

    updated SimpleGameLoop package to v4.0.0 which removes turnOn and turnOff methods from iUpdateable interface
    made turnOn/Off methods private in each class that implements iUpdateable
    this behaviour should be used internally only

    completely re-factored core DynamicObjects:
        unit
        number
        vector
        bezier
    
    implemented the Template Method Pattern to vastly reduce code duplication

    added clone() method to DynamicUnit, BaseDynamicUnit & decorators
        clone() returns a new iDynamicUnit object with the same ease and duration applied (but not internal state)
    
    changeTo() method now returns the set or calculated duration, which is very useful for the client

    removed changeBy/moveBy() methods as easily implemented by client in any case and not many use cases in reality

    added:

    DynamicString
        a user-defined, changeable string that lengthens over time from empty to full string
        client can set duration and ease
        useful effect for a game console window

    DynamicColor
        a color in rgb() string format that can change over time
        useful effect for game timer
    
    DynamicRotation
        contains a dynamic number
        client can rotateTo() a rotation, which behaves like changeTo() on DynamicNumber
        OR spinTo(), passing in the number of spins (negative for anti-clockwise), which adds numSpins onto total rotation
        the additional "spin" is then removed on update complete. 
        Rotation.current appears the same but no longer unwinds the spin on next rotation.

    DynamicRectangle
        most of the package functionality in one composite class
        consists of DymamicPosition, DynamicRotation and multiple DynamicNumbers
        uses the same syntax and style as the other DynamicObjects
        contains methods to set the following properties of a rectangle instantly or dynamically:
            position
            rotation
            opacity
            scale
            width
            height
            visible

v4.0.0 - scrapped

v5.0.0

    package completely re-written
    
    added:
        DynamicDimension
        DynamicOpacity
        DynamicScale
        DynamicSequence
        DynamicText (replaces DynamicString)
        DynamicTimer
        DynamicVisibility
        DynamicWaveForm
    
    ALL objects pass their updated jest tests
    tested all new functionality visually in browser

v6.0.0
completely re-factored for latest version of bastard brag
objects have a different api and funciton differently
client can now make deferred changes to each object and implement changes by calling next() Method
tested all thoroughly manually in the browser
will need to write unit tests before altering the objects any further
